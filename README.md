**ABOUT**

This is a randomizer for Bravely Default: Where the Fairy Flies.

**OPTIONS**

Several options are available:

- Shuffle job abilities (commands, spells, and support skills).

- Random job specialties

- Shuffle job stats ("affinities")

- Shuffle treasure chests and hidden items

- QOL: Scale experience, JP, and pg earned from battles.

**USAGE**

To run the executable from the Releases page, it is assumed that you
have [dumped your
cartridge](https://gist.github.com/PixelSergey/73d0a4bc1437dbaa53a1d1ce849fdda1).

The gui outputs a directory entitled ```seed_<number>``` which
contains a spoiler log, a file `settings.json`, and a folder
`romfs`. The settings file is a record of selected options.

The patch itself is contained in the folder `romfs`, and can be run on
your console with [Luma
LayeredFS](https://gist.github.com/PixelSergey/5dbb4a9b90d290736353fa58e4fcbb42).
